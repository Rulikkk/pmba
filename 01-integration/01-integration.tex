\pmbaQuestion
  {Your team just \emph{released} a working version of a software product. The customer is \emph{happy}, but he has a few \emph{new} feature requests. As a project manager, what do you do?}
  {Implement them}
  {Ask for more money}
  {Refuse, play ``hard to get''}
  {Close the project}

\pmbaQuestion
  {At a job interview, they ask you: ``What was the most \emph{successful} project where you were a project manager?''. What do you answer?}
  {``The one that made \$1 million to the customer''}
  {``The one that helped save people's lives''}
  {``The one where I made six-figure annual bonus''}
  {``I don't know...''}

\pmbaQuestion
  {You are a \emph{project manager}, a customer asks you: "Will you release a working software in three months, with all features implemented?'' You answer:}
  {``Well, I don't know...''}
  {``I believe so! We will do our best!''}
  {``Maybe, if you double the budget to cover all risks''}
  {``Yes, of course!''}

\pmbaQuestion
  {Close to the end of the project a programmer asks you whether she will get a bonus when the project \emph{finishes} successfully. What do you answer?}
  {``I will do my best to get it for you!''}
  {``It depends on many factors''}
  {``Do you think you deserve it?''}
  {``Of course, not!''}
