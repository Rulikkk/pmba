\begin{abstract}
Today, Agile has emerged as a widely-used term among managers overseeing software development projects. Nonetheless, it's important to note that Agile is not a management framework per se, but rather a set of guiding principles intended for managers already utilizing an established framework, such as IBM's RUP\REG{} or Microsoft's MSF\REG{}. Furthermore, the PMBOKâ„¢ by PMI\REG{} posits that project management is a deterministic endeavor, regulated by stringent rules and even laws. This course seeks to form a connection between the traditionally dry formalism of project management and the progressive practices of Agile/XP.
\end{abstract}

% \section*{Introduction}

\textbf{What is the goal?}\\
The main aim of this course is to enable students to comprehend the core principles of project management as outlined by PMBOK\TM{}. It further encourages them to implement these principles in practical scenarios, particularly in commercial and open-source software development projects.

\textbf{Who is the teacher?}\\
Yegor is developing software for more than 30 years, being a hands-on programmer
(see his GitHub account: \href{https://github.com/yegor256}{@yegor256})
and a manager of other programmers. At the moment, he is a director
of an R\&D laboratory in Huawei. His recent conference talks are in
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q}{his YouTube channel}.
He also published a \href{https://www.yegor256.com/books.html}{few books}
and wrote a \href{https://www.yegor256.com/contents.html}{blog} about software engineering
and OOP.
He previously taught a few courses in
Innopolis University (Kazan, Russia)
and HSE University (Moscow, Russia),
for example,
\href{https://github.com/yegor256/ssd16}{SSD16 (2021)},
\href{https://github.com/yegor256/eqsp}{EQSP (2022)},
and
\href{https://github.com/yegor256/ppa}{PPA (2023)}
(all videos are available).

\textbf{Why this course?}\\
Agile, viewed as a software development philosophy, can be highly effective when applied by those well-versed in essential project management principles, such as scope, cost, and risk management. However, as Agile's popularity rises, there's an observed decline in the understanding of project management as a scientific discipline, a trend noted among both new graduates and experienced software engineers and managers. This course aims to enhance such understanding, minimizing the tedium typically associated with traditional management disciplines.

\textbf{What's the methodology?}\\
Each lecture engages in an analysis of several practical scenarios within a software development team. The aim is to discern both productive and unproductive situations. From these observations, conclusions are drawn that help students gain a clearer understanding and improved perspective of their own management decisions.

\section*{Course Structure}

Prerequisites to the course (it is expected that a student knows this):

\begin{itemize}
\item How to write code
\item How to design software
\end{itemize}

After the course a student \emph{hopefully} will understand:

\begin{itemize}
\item How to draw a Gantt Chart and what for?
\item How to fire an under-performing team member?
\item How to create and maintain a Risk List?
\item How to identify risks in a project?
\item How to do quantitative and qualitative risk analysis?
\item How to report project status to a project sponsor?
\item How to estimate project costs?
\item How to calculate project budget?
\item How to avoid ``Gold Platting''?
\item How to decompose project scope into work packages?
\item How to measure performance of each team member?
\item How to optimize critical path using CPM?
\item How to work with a traceability matrix?
\item How to specify requirements unambiguously?
\item How to organize the work of a Change Control Board?
\item How to motivate programmers for higher productivity?
\item How to structure a software development contract?
\end{itemize}

% \section*{Lectures}

% The following topics are discussed:

% \newlist{lectures}{enumerate}{10}
% \setlist[lectures]{label*=\arabic*.}
% \begin{lectures}
% \item Algorithms
% \item Static Methods
% \item Getters
% \item Setters
% \item ``-er'' suffix
% \item NULL references
% \item Type casting and reflection
% \item Inheritance
% \end{lectures}

\newpage
\section*{Grading}

At the exam, each student will pick a ``scenario'' and will have to
explain what is the right behavior of a manager in this particular case.
The student will have to argue for the plan suggested. The quality of
the argument will impact the final score.

The attendance is tracked at the lectures. If 75\% of all lectures were attended,
it guarantees ``C'' (otherwise ignored).
